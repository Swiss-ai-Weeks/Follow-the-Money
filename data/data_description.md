# P2P Fraud Detection Challenge: Your Mission Briefing

## Welcome, Digital Detective! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You have been recruited to join Viseca's elite fraud detection task force. Your mission is to uncover hidden patterns in a sea of peer-to-peer transactions and help protect hard-earned savings from sophisticated fraudsters.

### Why This Dataset Exists

This dataset mixes synthetic and real fully anonymized data.

- **Safe to Explore**: a safe playground to test the most exciting new methodologies or well-tested, reliable ML tactics.
- **Realistic Yet Simplified**: The dataset captures the essence of real payment patterns while keeping things manageable.
- **Perfectly Balanced**: It is balanced so you have enough cases to explore and detect interesting patterns, while still maintaining a high class imbalance (a key feature and challenge in fraud detection).
- **Realistic Fraud Patterns**: Some subtle fraud patterns have been embedded to test your detection skills, while keeping the complexity manageable for an engaging hackathon.

## Your Data

Data is the most important tool for detectives and AI/ML researchers. Real data present complex, multidimensional challenges. Here, the schema is simpler than what you would find in Viseca's data lakes, but it is complete and broad enough for interesting feature engineering.

### Core Tables

**Customers** (`customers.csv`)
Your everyday people with ages, genders, and cities

**Accounts** (`accounts.csv`)
Each belongs to a customer and can be active or inactive

**P2P Transactions** (`p2p_transactions.csv`) - **Your Main Target!**
The peer-to-peer payments: friend splitting dinner, paying rent, sending gifts

### Additional Info to Know Better Our Customers

**Cards** (`cards.csv`)
Credit cards belonging to our customers and linked to accounts with different tiers: Standard, Gold, Platinum

**Card Transactions** (`card_transactions.csv`)
